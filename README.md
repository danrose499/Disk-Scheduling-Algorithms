### Task:  
Write a program that implements the following disk-scheduling algorithms:
1. FCFS
2. SSTF
3. SCAN
4. C-SCAN
5. LOOK  

Your program will service a disk with 10,000 cylinders numbered 0 to 9,999. The program will generate a random series of 1,000 cylinder requests and service them according to each of the algorithms listed above. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head (as a parameter on the command line), and report the total amount of head movement required by each algorithm. Your program should show the results of each algorithm in a table.  
You may use any programming language and add comments to your code.
